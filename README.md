# TrafficSignRecognition-CNN

This project uses kaggle Traffic Sign Recognition dataset.
The Train datafolder is used to train the model, and the model is tested using Test.csv.
So important folders for this project are Train, Test, Test.csv.

Instead of using Train and Test folders, we can also use train-1 and test-1 folders as alternatives to train the model.
Meta data is also provided in the kaggle dataset.
