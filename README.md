# TrafficSignRecognition-CNN

This project uses kaggle Traffic Sign Recognition dataset.
The Train datafolder is used to train the model, and the model is tested using Test.csv.
So important folder for this prject is Train, Test, Test.csv.

Instead of using Train and Test folders, we can also use train-1 and test-1 folder as alternative to train the model.
